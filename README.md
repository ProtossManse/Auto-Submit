Run application before start a run.

**Do not use outdated version!**



## Linux

You must be root to use Keyboard library on Linux.

**So you have to run the app using the command below:**


```
sudo ./MCAutoSubmit_v1.2.3_Linux
```


I'm trying to solve this problem.


## Features

- **Auto Read World Data**: Automattically detects Difficulty, F3, IGT, Mods, Seed and Version. So you just input video URL and comment.

- **Auto Submit**: Using an API, you can automatically submit by one click.

- **Remember Comment**: You don't have to rack your brains to comment anymore.

- **Support Korean and English**: I've no plans to add more languages.

## Recommended

- **[GhostRunner](https://github.com/RedLime/GhostRunner)**: You can use more accurate IGT and RTA.
